                    The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating system is used in the United States and its territories to rate a 
                film's suitability for certain audiences based on its content. The MPAA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law; 
                films can be exhibited without a rating, although certain theaters refuse to exhibit non-rated or NC-17 rated films. 
                Non-members of MPAA may also submit films for rating. Other media, such as television programs, music and video games, 
                are rated by other entities such as the TV Parental Guidelines, the RIAA and the ESRB.

                    The MPAA rating system is one of various motion picture rating systems that are used to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children. 
                    It is administered by the Classification & Ratings Administration (CARA), an independent division of the MPAA.
